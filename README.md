# 🔐 Cybersecurity & Networking Labs Portfolio

Welcome! 👋

This repository is my personal hands-on lab portfolio documenting practical work in networking, cybersecurity, and defensive security fundamentals. Every lab here follows a learning-by-doing approach: I design environments, configure systems, test scenarios, break things intentionally, troubleshoot them, and document what I learn.

This repository is not a code library. It is evidence of real technical practice, problem-solving, and security thinking.

🎯 Purpose of This Repository

The goals of this portfolio are to:

✅ Demonstrate real, hands-on technical practice (not theory-only work)

✅ Provide clear proof of work (screenshots, configurations, logs, notes)

✅ Build and reinforce strong networking & security fundamentals

✅ Show how I think through problems, alerts, and investigations

This repo is intentionally detailed so others can learn from the process, not just the final result.

## 🎯 What You’ll Find In This Repo

This repo includes labs and notes in areas like:

### 🌐 Networking
- OSI & TCP/IP concepts (how traffic moves)
- IP addressing + subnetting practice
- VLANs and network segmentation
- Routing concepts (and troubleshooting paths)
- NAT basics
- Packet Tracer network builds + diagrams

### 🕵️ Traffic Analysis (Wireshark)
- Capturing DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, TCP, UDP
- TCP 3-way handshake analysis (SYN → SYN/ACK → ACK)
- Filtering traffic by IP, port, and protocol
- Explaining packets in a simple, readable way

### 🧱 Firewalls + Network Defense
- Firewall rules (allow/deny, inbound/outbound)
- NAT rules and why they matter
- pfSense configurations and screenshots
- IDS/IPS concepts + alert testing (example: scans generating alerts)

### 🧩 Identity & System Security
- Windows user/group basics
- Basic policy hardening examples (like password rules)
- Event log review (login failures, suspicious activity)

### 📊 Logging & Alerting
- Searching logs to find suspicious behavior
- Creating simple alerts (example: failed login patterns)
- Writing short investigation notes based on evidence

### 🧪 Security Testing (Controlled Labs)
- Port/service scanning in isolated environments
- Vulnerability scanning practice (reporting + remediation notes)
- Web app security practice (learning common vulnerabilities)

## 🧾 What Each Lab Includes

Most labs include:

✅ **Goal of the lab** (what I’m trying to learn)  
✅ **Tools used** (example: Wireshark, Packet Tracer, pfSense, etc.)  
✅ **Steps taken** (so someone else can repeat it)  
✅ **Screenshots** (proof of work + evidence)  
✅ **What I learned** (short, honest takeaways)  
✅ **Security / real-world note** (why this matters in real systems)

---

## 🧰 Tools I Commonly Use

These may appear throughout the repo:

- 🖥️ VirtualBox / VMware (virtual lab environments)
- 🧪 Kali Linux + Windows + Linux VMs
- 🌐 Wireshark (packet capture + analysis)
- 🧱 pfSense (firewall + NAT practice)
- 🛡️ Suricata (IDS alert testing)
- 🧠 Packet Tracer (network builds + simulations)
- 📊 Log tools / SIEM practice (searching + alerts)
- 🔎 Scanning tools (only in controlled environments)

---

## ✅ How To Use This Repo

If you’re reviewing this repo, here are easy ways to navigate:

1. Start with **Networking Foundations** if you want basics
2. Check **Wireshark** folders if you like traffic analysis
3. Look at **Firewall/IDS** if you want defensive work
4. Open the **Investigation write-ups** if you want to see how I think through alerts

## 📌 Notes & Safety

⚠️ All work in this repository is performed in isolated lab environments.

❌ No scanning or testing of systems I do not own

❌ No unauthorized or real‑world attacks

✅ All activities are strictly for educational and defensive learning purposes

This repository is intended for learning, documentation, and professional development.
