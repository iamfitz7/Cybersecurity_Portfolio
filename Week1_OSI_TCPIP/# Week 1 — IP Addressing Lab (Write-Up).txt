# Week 1 — IP Addressing Lab (Packet Tracer)

**Objective:** Assign static IPv4 addresses to two PCs in the same subnet, verify connectivity.

**Topology:** Two PCs connected directly with a copper crossover cable.

**Devices & Software:**
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- PC0 (Desktop)
- PC1 (Desktop)

**IP scheme:**
- PC0: 192.168.1.10 /24
- PC1: 192.168.1.11 /24
- Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
- Gateway: (none used for this lab — same subnet)

**Steps performed:**
1. Launched Packet Tracer, added 2 PCs (PC0, PC1).
2. Connected PCs using copper crossover cable (auto-select).
3. On each PC → Desktop → IP Configuration: set static IPv4 addresses as above.
4. From PC0: `ping 192.168.1.11` — received replies (4/4).
5. Captured screenshot: `PC0_cmd_ping_192.168.1.11.png` and `PacketTracer_topology.png`.

**Verification:**  
Ping replies show 0% packet loss and TTL responses, confirming Layer 3 connectivity within the same subnet.

**What I learned / notes:**
- IP address and subnet mask determine whether two hosts are local (same subnet).
- No gateway needed when both hosts are on the same subnet and directly connected.
- APIPA (169.254.x.x) appears when DHCP fails but it's just not being used here.
