WEEK 2 LAB: TCP VS UDP ANALYSIS USING WIRESHARK

OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this lab was to understand the differences between TCP and UDP by capturing and analyzing real network traffic using Wireshark in a Kali Linux virtual machine. The lab focused on observing how TCP establishes reliable connections and how UDP operates without a connection, using HTTP and DNS traffic as examples.

ENVIRONMENT SETUP
Host Operating System: Windows 11
Virtualization Software: Oracle VirtualBox
Guest Operating System: Kali Linux
Network Interface Used: eth0 (NAT)
Packet Analysis Tool: Wireshark

STEP 1: VERIFY NETWORK CONFIGURATION
Before capturing traffic, the network configuration was verified using the command:

ip a

This confirmed that the eth0 interface was active and had an assigned IP address, indicating that the virtual machine had internet connectivity.

Purpose:
This step ensured that the system was properly connected to the network so that real traffic could be captured in Wireshark.

STEP 2: START WIRESHARK PACKET CAPTURE
Wireshark was opened and packet capture was started on the eth0 network interface.

Purpose:
Capturing traffic on the active interface allows real network protocols to be observed as they operate.

STEP 3: GENERATE TCP TRAFFIC
TCP traffic was generated using the following command:

curl http://example.com

This command created an HTTP request, which uses the TCP protocol on port 80.

In Wireshark, the following filter was applied:

tcp

Observed TCP behavior included:

TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)

Data transmission over an established connection

Connection termination using FIN and ACK packets

Purpose:
This step demonstrated how TCP establishes a reliable, connection-oriented session before data is transmitted.

STEP 4: GENERATE UDP TRAFFIC
UDP traffic was generated by performing a DNS lookup using the command:

dig google.com

In Wireshark, the following filter was applied:

udp

Observed UDP behavior included:

DNS queries and responses over port 53

No handshake or connection establishment

Faster, connectionless communication

Purpose:
This step showed how UDP operates without reliability guarantees, prioritizing speed instead.

STEP 5: SAVE PACKET CAPTURE
The packet capture was saved from Wireshark with the following details:

File name: Week2_TCP_UDP_Wireshark.pcapng
Save location: /media/sf_Kali_Shared

This allowed the capture file to be accessed from the Windows host system.

Purpose:
Saving captures to a shared folder reflects real-world network analysis workflows where evidence must be exported and reviewed externally.

KEY OBSERVATIONS

TCP:

Connection-oriented

Reliable delivery

Uses handshakes and acknowledgments

UDP:

Connectionless

Faster transmission

No delivery guarantees

CONCLUSION
This lab provided hands-on experience analyzing TCP and UDP traffic using Wireshark. TCP was observed to establish reliable connections using handshakes, while UDP was observed sending traffic without connection setup. This lab reinforced how different protocols are used for different networking purposes in real environments.
