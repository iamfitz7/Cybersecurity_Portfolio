SOC Case File — Probable Malware Beaconing Outbound Traffic (Alert B)

Case Overview

This case documents the analysis and decision-making process for a Probable Malware Beaconing Outbound Traffic alert generated by Splunk Enterprise Security. The alert was triggered based on repeated outbound network connections consistent with beaconing behavior observed in proxy logs.

The objective of this case was not to confirm malware, but to determine the appropriate SOC L1 response, escalation path, and whether detection tuning was required.

Alert Metadata

Alert Name: Probable Malware Beaconing Outbound Traffic Identified

Alert Type: Finding

Urgency: Medium

Detection Source: Zscaler proxy logs (CSV ingestion)

Event Count: ~349 events

Destination IP: 203.0.113.45

MITRE ATT&CK Techniques:

T1021.001

T1071

T1086

Observed Behavior

Repeated outbound connections to the same external destination

Consistent timing patterns indicative of beacon-like traffic

Activity observed across proxy logs rather than endpoint telemetry

No direct payload inspection or endpoint process context available

The detection correctly identified behavioral indicators, not confirmed malicious execution.

Initial Analyst Assessment

The alert exhibited characteristics commonly associated with command-and-control beaconing, including repetition and destination consistency. However, the data available at the L1 level lacked sufficient enrichment to conclusively confirm malicious activity.

Notably missing context included:

Endpoint process name

Parent-child process relationships

Command-line execution details

User attribution at the endpoint level

Confirmed malicious domain or IP reputation

Decision Rationale (SOC L1 Judgment)

This alert required a mixed response based on evidence quality and operational boundaries.

Escalate

Beaconing behavior is present and aligns with known threat patterns

Repeated outbound traffic warrants deeper investigation

Potential risk exists if left unreviewed

Tune Detection

Detection relies heavily on frequency and pattern matching

Lack of endpoint context increases false-positive risk

Additional enrichment is required for higher-confidence decisions

This balanced approach ensures potential threats are investigated without overreacting based on incomplete data.

Action Taken

Alert reviewed and documented at the L1 level

Decision recorded as Mixed: Escalate + Tune

Escalation recommended to L2 for endpoint correlation

Detection engineering feedback suggested to improve rule enrichment

What L1 Did Not Do (By Design)

No endpoint remediation attempted

No IP blocking performed without confirmation

No assumption of compromise based solely on traffic frequency

No false positive closure without sufficient evidence

These actions were intentionally avoided to maintain proper role boundaries and workflow discipline.

Handoff Summary

To L2 / Incident Response:
Endpoint telemetry review, process attribution, user context validation

To Detection Engineering:
Improve rule enrichment with endpoint and process-level data to reduce ambiguity

My Takeaway

This case demonstrates that effective SOC work is not about forcing conclusions, but about routing decisions correctly based on evidence quality. Recognizing when to escalate, when to tune, and when not to act is a critical skill for real-world security operations.
