SOC Case File — Suspicious Process Activity (PowerShell LOLBAS) — Alert A

Case Overview

This case documents the investigation and decision-making process for a Suspicious Process Activity alert involving PowerShell execution on a user workstation. The alert was generated by Splunk Enterprise Security based on endpoint telemetry indicating potential LOLBAS-style behavior.

The purpose of this case was to determine whether the observed PowerShell activity represented normal administrative behavior or a credible security threat requiring escalation.

Alert Metadata

Alert Name: Suspicious Process Activity detected on Workstation-03 from user user1

Alert Type: Investigation

Urgency: High

Detection Source: Endpoint telemetry (process execution)

Host: Workstation-03

User: user1

Detection Rule: Suspicious Process Activity (Endpoint)

MITRE ATT&CK Techniques:

T1059.001 (PowerShell)

T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer – via Invoke-WebRequest)

Observed Behavior

PowerShell execution initiated by a user context

Use of Invoke-WebRequest, a known LOLBAS technique

Command-line activity consistent with remote content retrieval

Behavior aligns with patterns commonly seen in initial access or staging activity

Unlike network-only alerts, this activity occurred directly on the endpoint and involved execution logic rather than passive traffic.

Initial Analyst Assessment

The alert immediately raised concern due to:

Use of PowerShell for network-based actions

Presence of a LOLBAS technique rather than a standard application

Execution under a user account rather than a known management process

There was no immediate indication that this activity was part of a known administrative script or sanctioned automation.

Decision Rationale (SOC L1 Judgment)

This alert met the threshold for immediate escalation.

Reasons for escalation:

Endpoint-level execution provides higher confidence than network-only signals

PowerShell + Invoke-WebRequest is frequently abused in real-world attacks

The behavior aligns with early-stage intrusion techniques

The potential impact of a missed threat is high

Unlike ambiguous alerts, this activity did not require tuning before response.

Action Taken

Alert reviewed and documented

Determined to be a True Positive–leaning event

Escalated to L2 / Incident Response for deeper investigation

Context preserved for follow-on analysis

What L1 Did Not Do (By Design)

No assumptions made about payload intent

No host isolation or remediation attempted

No rule modification performed

No false positive closure without validation

These actions were deferred to higher tiers with appropriate access and authority.

Handoff Summary

To L2 / Incident Response:
Full endpoint investigation, process tree analysis, command-line reconstruction, user activity review

To Detection Engineering:
No tuning required at this stage; detection behavior aligns with expected alerting goals

My Takeaway

This case demonstrates a clear example of when decisive escalation is required. Endpoint-based PowerShell activity using LOLBAS techniques represents a high-risk scenario where delaying action could result in missed compromise.

Proper SOC judgment means escalating confidently when evidence supports it—without overanalyzing or minimizing risk.
