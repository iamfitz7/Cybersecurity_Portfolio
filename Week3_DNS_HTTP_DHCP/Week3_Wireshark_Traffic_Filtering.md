Wireshark Traffic Filtering — IP & Protocol Analysis

Overview

In this lab, I analyzed live network traffic using Wireshark with a focus on filtering by protocol and IP address. The goal was to reduce background noise and isolate traffic that actually matters during troubleshooting or investigation. Instead of reviewing all captured packets, I applied targeted filters to quickly surface DNS, HTTP, and host-specific traffic. This approach mirrors how network issues are handled in real environments, where time and clarity matter.

Analysis & Reasoning

At the start of the capture, the traffic volume was intentionally mixed, including ICMP, DNS, and HTTP packets. My first assumption was that without filtering, identifying meaningful behavior would be slow and error-prone. I began by filtering traffic by protocol (DNS and HTTP) to confirm that name resolution and web requests were occurring as expected.

Next, I filtered traffic by my host IP address to focus only on packets involving the system under review. This immediately ruled out unrelated broadcast and background traffic. I then combined protocol and IP filters to narrow results further, allowing me to view only DNS or HTTP traffic generated by a single host. This step demonstrated how layered filtering turns a large capture into a manageable and readable data set.

The conclusions were based on whether expected packets appeared consistently and whether responses matched requests, rather than simply confirming that traffic existed.

Outcome & Decision

Based on the filtered results, the appropriate action would be to continue monitoring if traffic patterns appear normal, or escalate for deeper inspection if expected responses are missing or inconsistent. Filtering makes it possible to reach this decision quickly without reviewing unnecessary packets. This approach supports faster troubleshooting and more confident conclusions.

Risks & Lessons Learned

If filtering is misunderstood or used incorrectly, important packets may be missed, leading to false assumptions about outages or failures. There is also a trade-off between being too broad (too much noise) and too narrow (missing context). The key lesson is that filters should be adjusted dynamically based on what question is being answered.

A common beginner mistake is relying only on scrolling instead of filters, which leads to confusion and wasted time. Proper filtering prevents this and keeps analysis focused.

Improvement Opportunity

A realistic improvement would be creating saved filter profiles for common scenarios, such as DNS troubleshooting or host-based analysis. This would reduce setup time during live investigations and improve consistency across captures.

Summary

This lab strengthened my ability to analyze network traffic by applying targeted Wireshark filters instead of reviewing raw captures. I practiced isolating traffic by protocol and IP address to identify relevant communication quickly. The experience reinforced how filtering supports efficient troubleshooting and clearer decision-making. These skills are essential for working with real network data in operational environments.
