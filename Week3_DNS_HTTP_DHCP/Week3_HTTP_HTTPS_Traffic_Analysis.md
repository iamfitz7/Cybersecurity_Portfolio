HTTP and HTTPS Traffic Analysis Using Wireshark

Overview:
In this lab, I captured and analyzed real web traffic generated by a browser to understand how HTTP and HTTPS requests behave on the network. The focus was on observing HTTP GET and POST requests, server responses, headers, and status codes, and then comparing that visibility to encrypted HTTPS traffic. This lab addresses a common question in networking and security: what web traffic details are visible on the network, and what are protected by encryption?

Understanding this behavior is important in real environments because web traffic is one of the most common sources of performance issues, misconfigurations, and security investigations.


Analysis and Reasoning:
The initial assumption was that loading a basic HTTP website would generate readable requests and responses that could be inspected in Wireshark. After starting packet capture on the active network interface, an HTTP site (http://example.com) was accessed to generate predictable traffic.

The first step in analysis was filtering traffic to only HTTP packets to reduce noise. From there, individual GET requests were examined to understand how browsers request resources. Key fields such as the request method, host header, user agent, and accepted content types were reviewed. This confirmed that the browser sends metadata describing both the resource being requested and the client making the request.

Next, the corresponding server response was analyzed. Status codes such as 200 OK were used to confirm successful requests, and response headers were reviewed to understand how servers describe content and behavior back to the client. A POST request was also generated to observe how data is sent from the client to the server, highlighting the difference between retrieving data (GET) and submitting data (POST).

To rule out the possibility that this visibility applied to all web traffic, an HTTPS site was accessed. When filtering for TLS traffic, it became clear that while connection metadata (such as ports and handshake behavior) was visible, the actual HTTP headers and payload were encrypted and unreadable.


Outcome and Decision:
Based on the observed traffic, the correct conclusion is that HTTP traffic exposes request and response details directly on the network, while HTTPS protects this information through encryption. In a real operational setting, this would lead to different actions depending on the situation. For HTTP traffic, detailed inspection could be used to troubleshoot application issues or investigate suspicious behavior. For HTTPS traffic, the appropriate response would usually be to rely on logs, endpoint data, or controlled decryption points rather than packet contents.

For an early-career professional, the reasonable action is to document findings clearly, confirm whether traffic is expected to be encrypted, and escalate only if visibility or behavior does not match security or operational expectations.

Risks and Lessons Learned:
A major risk highlighted by this lab is assuming that all web traffic is protected by default. Misconfigured services using HTTP instead of HTTPS can expose sensitive data such as credentials or session information. There is also a trade-off between visibility and privacy: while encryption limits packet-level inspection, it significantly improves security and user trust.

A common beginner mistake is expecting to see full HTTP headers inside HTTPS captures and assuming something is broken when they are not visible. This lab reinforces that encryption is working as intended, not failing.

Improvement Opportunity:
Based on this lab, one improvement in a real environment would be relying on centralized web server logs or application telemetry to gain visibility into HTTPS traffic without weakening encryption. This provides insight into web behavior without relying on deep packet inspection of encrypted traffic. Clear documentation of which services are expected to use HTTP versus HTTPS would also reduce confusion during troubleshooting and security reviews.

Summary:
This lab provided hands-on experience analyzing real HTTP and HTTPS traffic at the packet level using Wireshark. By inspecting GET and POST requests, response headers, and status codes, I gained a clearer understanding of how browsers and servers communicate and how encryption changes network visibility. The comparison between HTTP and HTTPS reinforced why encryption is essential for protecting data in transit. This exercise strengthened my ability to reason through web-related network issues using evidence rather than assumptions.
