# 🛡️ Week 9 — SIEM Basics with Splunk

This folder documents hands-on work with a SIEM platform, focusing on log collection, searching, alerting, and basic reporting using security event data from a Windows system. The goal is to show how security activity is monitored and reviewed in a centralized tool.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Understand how a SIEM collects and displays logs  
- Practice writing basic search queries  
- Build simple dashboards for visibility  
- Create alerts for suspicious behavior  
- Review and filter logs during investigation  

---

## ⚙️ SIEM Setup
**What I did:**  
Set up the SIEM platform and confirmed it was running and accessible.

**Artifacts added:**  
- Screenshot showing the SIEM interface running

**Why this matters:**  
A working SIEM is required before logs, searches, and alerts can function properly.

## 📥 Windows Event Log Ingestion
**What I did:**  
Collected Windows Event Logs and sent them into the SIEM for monitoring.

**Artifacts added:**  
- Screenshot showing Windows Event Logs being received

**Why this matters:**  
Event logs provide key security data such as login activity and system events.

---

## 🔍 Searches and Dashboards
**What I did:**  
Created search queries and dashboards to display important events, including failed login attempts.

**Artifacts added:**  
- Search result screenshots  
- Dashboard screenshots  

**Why this matters:**  
Dashboards and searches help quickly identify patterns and potential issues.

---

## 🚨 Alerts and Detection
**What I did:**  
Set up alerts to trigger when suspicious activity, such as port scans, is detected.

**Artifacts added:**  
- Screenshot of alert configuration  
- Screenshot showing the alert trigger  

**Why this matters:**  
Alerts help detect threats without constant manual monitoring.

---

## 📊 Filtering and Reporting
**What I did:**  
Filtered logs by IP address and severity to focus on specific security events.

**Artifacts added:**  
- Screenshots of filtered searches  

**Why this matters:**  
Filtering reduces noise and helps narrow down relevant activity faster.
